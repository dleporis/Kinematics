The topic of my 2nd-semester project was laser-welding of Grundfos pump impeller with Universal Robots UR5 robot. 
The first step was making a CAD model in Solidworks, Then I imported the CAD model into RoboDK simulation software,
where I selected welding paths and waypoints and checked for potential collisions and singularities of the robot model.

I made a robot simulation in a software RoboDK https://robodk.com/ named final_robot_station.rdk
A built-in pre-processor generated a Python-based URscript files containing trajectories for the robot. 
These are located in /working_inside_out and /working_outside_in
Then I 3D-printed fixtures to hold the impeller on the table and a to attach the laser pointer to the end-effector.
I uploaded the URscript files to a UR5 teach pendant, and executed them on UR5 robot with the laser pointer "welding" the part with the given trajectories

The impeller CAD files, laser pointer tool fixture, and impeller tavle fixtures are in /CAD folder
